# TIC-TAC-TOE

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid with "X" or "O". The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
This project implements Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring:
🧠 Interactive grid-based gameplay
🔁 Real-time turn switching
❌ Win/draw detection logic
♻️ Game reset functionality

It offers an engaging way to practice basic programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, DOM manipulation, and event handling — all within a fun and familiar game interface.
